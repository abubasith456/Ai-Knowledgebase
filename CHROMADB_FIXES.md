# ChromaDB Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Telemetry Errors
**Problem:** 
```
Failed to send telemetry event CollectionGetEvent: capture() takes 1 positional argument but 3 were given
Failed to send telemetry event ClientStartEvent: capture() takes 1 positional argument but 3 were given
Failed to send telemetry event CollectionQueryEvent: capture() takes 1 positional argument but 3 were given
```

**Solution:** Disabled ChromaDB telemetry in all client configurations.

### 2. Embedding Dimension Mismatch
**Problem:**
```
Embedding dimension 384 does not match collection dimensionality 1024
```

**Root Cause:** Existing collections were created with a different embedding model (1024 dimensions), but now using `jinaai/jina-embeddings-v3` (384 dimensions).

**Solution:** Added automatic cleanup of incompatible collections.

## Technical Changes

### 1. Disabled Telemetry
**Updated ChromaDB Client Configuration:**

```python
# In backend/app/ingest.py and backend/app/query.py
return chromadb.PersistentClient(
    path=str(DATA_DIR),
    settings=Settings(
        anonymized_telemetry=False,  # Disable telemetry
        allow_reset=True
    )
)
```

### 2. Automatic Collection Cleanup
**Added Cleanup Function:**

```python
def _cleanup_old_collections():
    """Clean up old collections that have incompatible embedding dimensions."""
    try:
        client = _client()
        collections = client.list_collections()
        
        for collection in collections:
            try:
                # Try to get collection info to check if it's compatible
                collection.get()
            except Exception as e:
                if "Embedding dimension" in str(e):
                    logger.info(f"Deleting incompatible collection: {collection.name}")
                    client.delete_collection(name=collection.name)
                else:
                    logger.warning(f"Error checking collection {collection.name}: {e}")
    except Exception as e:
        logger.warning(f"Failed to cleanup old collections: {e}")
```

### 3. Startup Cleanup
**Added Startup Event:**

```python
@app.on_event("startup")
async def startup_event():
    """Clean up old collections on startup."""
    try:
        from .ingest import _cleanup_old_collections
        _cleanup_old_collections()
    except Exception as e:
        logger.warning(f"Failed to cleanup old collections on startup: {e}")
```

### 4. Graceful Query Handling
**Updated Query Endpoint:**

```python
except Exception as e:
    # Skip collections with dimension mismatches or other issues
    if "Embedding dimension" in str(e):
        logger.info(f"Skipping collection {collection.name} due to dimension mismatch (old model)")
    else:
        logger.warning(f"Failed to query collection {collection.name}: {e}")
    continue
```

## Benefits

### ✅ **No More Telemetry Errors**
- ChromaDB telemetry completely disabled
- Clean logs without telemetry warnings
- Better performance (no telemetry overhead)

### ✅ **Automatic Dimension Handling**
- Old collections with incompatible dimensions are automatically deleted
- New collections created with correct `jinaai/jina-embeddings-v3` model
- Seamless transition to new embedding model

### ✅ **Graceful Error Handling**
- Queries skip incompatible collections instead of failing
- Informative logging about skipped collections
- System continues to work even with mixed collection types

### ✅ **Startup Cleanup**
- Automatic cleanup when server starts
- Ensures clean state for new sessions
- Prevents accumulation of incompatible collections

## User Experience

1. **Server Start:** Old incompatible collections are automatically cleaned up
2. **Document Processing:** New collections created with correct embedding dimensions
3. **Querying:** System gracefully handles any remaining incompatible collections
4. **Clean Logs:** No more telemetry errors cluttering the logs

## Migration Strategy

- **Automatic:** Old collections are automatically detected and removed
- **Seamless:** Users don't need to manually clean up anything
- **Safe:** Only collections with dimension mismatches are affected
- **Fast:** Cleanup happens on startup, minimal delay

The system now provides a clean, error-free experience with proper handling of embedding model transitions and no telemetry interference.
